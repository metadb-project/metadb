=== Data type conversion

When reading data from a data source, Metadb will automatically adjust column
data types in a number of cases:

* A data type in the source has changed in a way that cannot be applied safely
  by Metadb without more information.

* A data type in the source has changed to a type that is not supported by
  Metadb.

* A data type in the source can be converted safely to a type that is more
  performant.

This table summarizes the type adjustments that are performed:
